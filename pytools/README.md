# Introduction
- plotsim.py
plot graphs
- 2linkanimation
generate an animation of simulation result of 2link arm

# Requirement
- Python3, numpy, seaborn (for plotsim.py, 2linkanimation.py)
- ffmpeg (to save animations generated by 2linkanimation.py)

# Usage
First, set the parameters of your model of NMPC in nmpc_model.hpp, write equations in nmpc_model.cpp, and set simulation conditions in main.cpp. Note that you can generate nmpc_model.hpp nmpc_model.cpp using codeGenforNMPC.ipynb in codeGen. Next, build files as follows:

After performing a numerical simulation, you can see graphs by

```
$ python3 plotsim.py example
```

save graphs by

```
$ python3 plotsim.py example save example
```

see an animation of 2link robot by

```
$ python3 2linkanimation.py example
```

and save its animation by

```
$ python3 2linkanimation.py example save example
```
