## Introduction
This project provides the continuation/GMRES method (C/GMRES method) based solvers for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and an automatic code generator for NMPC, called AutoGenU.

The following C/GMRES based solvers are provided: 
- `MultipleShootingCGMRESSolver` : The multiple shooting based C/GMRES method with condensing of the state and the Lagragne multipliers with respect to the state equation.
- `SingleShootingCGMRESSolver` : The original C/GMRES method (single shooting).

## Requirement
- C++17 (MinGW or MSYS and PATH to either are required for Windows users)
- CMake
- Python 3.8 or later, Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, SymPy (to generate `ocp.hpp`, `main.cpp`, and `CMakeLists.txt` by `AutoGenU.ipynb`)
- Python 3.8 or later, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn (to plot simulation data on `AutoGenU.ipynb`)
- ffmpeg (to generate animations in `pendubot.ipynb`, `cartpole.ipynb`, `hexacopter.ipynb`, and `mobilerobot.ipynb`)

## Usage
### Submodules 
Please confirm that you clone this repository as 
```
git clone https://github.com/mayataka/autogenu-jupyter --recursive
```
Otherwise, please do the following command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### AutoGenU
`AutoGenU.ipynb` generates following source files under your setting state equation, constraints, cost function, and parameters: 
- `ocp.hpp`  
- `main.cpp`  
- `CMakeLists.txt`

You can also build source files for numerical simulation, execute numerical simulation, and plot or save simulation result on `AutoGenU.ipynb`.


### C/GMRES based solvers of NMPC
The C/GMRES based solvers in `src/solver` directory can be used independently of `AutoGenU.ipynb`. You are then required the following files:
- `ocp.hpp`: write the optimal control problem (OCP) in your model  

In addition to these files, you have to write `CMakeLists.txt` to build source files.


## Demos
Demos are presented in `cartpole.ipynb`, `pendubot.ipynb`, `hexacopter.ipynb`, and `mobilerobot.ipynb`. You can obtain the following simulation results jusy by runnig these `.ipynb` files. The details of the each OCP formulations are described in each `.ipynb` files.
